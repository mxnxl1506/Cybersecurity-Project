# Password Cracker

This project demonstrates a basic password cracker using a dictionary attack approach.

## Features
- Uses a list of common passwords to crack SHA-256 hashed passwords.
- Implements a simple brute-force technique for password cracking.

## Usage
1. Update the `hash_to_crack` variable with the SHA-256 hash value of the target password.
2. Modify the `common_passwords` list with potential passwords to test.

## Security Considerations
- Use only for educational purposes and with proper authorization.
- Do not use real passwords or hashes without permission.
