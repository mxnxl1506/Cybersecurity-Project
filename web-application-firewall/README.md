# Web Application Firewall (WAF)

This project implements a basic Web Application Firewall (WAF) in Python to detect and prevent common attacks such as SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by analyzing HTTP request parameters for malicious patterns.

## Features
- **SQL Injection Detection**: Identifies SQL injection attack patterns in HTTP requests.
- **XSS Detection**: Detects Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack patterns in HTTP requests.

## Usage
1. Modify the `web_application_firewall.py` script to integrate with your web application's request handling logic.
2. Implement additional security rules and validation techniques based on specific application requirements.

### Important Note
- **Customization**: Customize and extend the WAF functionalities based on your application's security needs.
- **Integration**: Integrate the WAF with your web application framework (e.g., Flask, Django) for real-time protection against common web attacks.

For more details, refer to the [web_application_firewall.py](./web_application_firewall.py) script.
