# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

This project implements a basic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using packet sniffing.

## Features
- Sniffs TCP packets on port 80 using Scapy.
- Displays summary of sniffed packets for intrusion detection.

## Usage
1. Run the script to start packet sniffing and intrusion detection.
2. Modify the packet filter (`filter="tcp and port 80"`) based on specific network traffic to monitor.

## Security Considerations
- Use responsibly and with proper authorization.
- Monitor network traffic in compliance with ethical guidelines.
