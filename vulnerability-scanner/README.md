# Vulnerability Scanner

This project implements a simple port scanner to detect open ports on a target host.

## Features
- Scans specified ports on a target host for open TCP connections.
- Uses socket programming in Python for port scanning.

## Usage
1. Modify the `target_host` and `target_port` variables in the script to specify the target.
2. Run the script to scan for open ports on the target host.

## Security Considerations
- Obtain proper authorization before scanning remote hosts.
- Use responsibly and in compliance with legal and ethical guidelines.
