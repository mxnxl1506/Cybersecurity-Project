# Encryption/Decryption Tool

This project demonstrates encryption and decryption of messages using the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm.

## Features
- Generates a random encryption key.
- Encrypts and decrypts messages using the generated key.

## Usage
1. Run the script to generate a new encryption key.
2. Provide a message to encrypt and decrypt using the generated key.

## Security Considerations
- Safeguard the encryption key to ensure secure message decryption.
- Use strong encryption algorithms for sensitive data.
