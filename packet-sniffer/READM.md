# Packet Sniffer

This project implements a packet sniffer using tcpdump for network traffic analysis.

## Features
- Captures packets on a specified network interface.
- Requires `sudo` privileges for packet capture.

## Usage
1. Ensure tcpdump is installed (`sudo apt install tcpdump` on Linux).
2. Run the script with sudo: `sudo python packet_sniffer.py`

## Security Considerations
- Use responsibly and obtain necessary permissions before packet sniffing.
- Analyze captured data in compliance with ethical guidelines.

For more details, refer to the [packet_sniffer.py](./packet_sniffer.py) script.
